WebApp &amp; XGBoost Model - Restaurant Rating Prediction  
This project uses machine learning, Python, and Streamlit to create a web application that predicts the rating of a restaurant on an online food delivery service.

<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
<b>
The data from an online food app, which needs assistance in predicting the future success or failure of a business (restaurant), has been used in this case study. Such that they can choose whether to delete the restaurant from their app or keep it. They have provided information from 9551 eateries from across the world that are currently accessible on their app. It contains details about the restaurants, including the overall rating.I developed a machine learning model that can forecast a restaurant's rating based on its attributes.

 <h2> Please find the App on the below link </h2>
 
  
Steps followed in building the Model:
1. Data cleaning & Preparation.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Missing Value & Outlier Treatment
4. Correlation testing & Statistical Analysis to confirm findings.
5. Feature Selection
6. Splitting the data: Training & Testing Set in the ratio of 70:30
7. Models Built:
  - Multiple Linear Regression 
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest 
  - XGBoost Model
8. Deployment of the Model using Streamlit Application.
